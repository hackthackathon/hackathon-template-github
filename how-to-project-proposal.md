# How to propose projects

For each project, submit a Project Proposal to this repository, identifying the scope of that topic. This will help ensure each project has a plan that can be executed during the event.

To submit topics of interest use the GitHub issue form below:

[repo org]/[repo name]/issues/new/choose
